## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] - 2025-04-13

### Added
- Added `--enable-console-logging` option to enable console logging (disabled by default to avoid stdio transport conflicts)

### Changed
- Changed default logging behavior to use file logging only, with console logging disabled by default

### Enhanced
- Extended `--disable-write-tools` flag to also disable Jupyter notebook editing tools

### Fixed
- Fixed critical issue where logging to stdout interfered with MCP server communication when using stdio transport
- Modified logging configuration to use stderr instead of stdout for console logging
- Automatically prevent console logging when using stdio transport to prevent protocol corruption
- Ensured command executor verbose logging consistently uses stderr

## [0.1.19] - 2025-03-28

### Added
- Added Agent Tool for task delegation and concurrent execution
  - Agent Tool enables Claude to delegate complex tasks to specialized sub-agents that can work in parallel, enhancing performance for complex operations like code search, analysis, and multi-step tasks
  - Agents use read-only tools to ensure safety while maintaining full access to information retrieval capabilities
  - Introduced new parameter `--enable-agent-tool` to allow users to control whether the agent tool is registered
  - Added parameters `--agent-max-iterations` (default: 30) and `--agent-max-tool-uses` (default: 100) to control agent behavior
  - Implemented multi-agent support to enable concurrent sub-agent execution for improved performance when handling multiple related tasks
  - Agents return results that are automatically formatted and integrated into Claude's responses
- Added LiteLLM integration to support various model providers beyond OpenAI
  - Command line support for specifying the model name, API key, and token limits
  - Support for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and other LLM providers
  - Simplified configuration through environment variables or command-line arguments

### Enhanced
- Enhanced system prompt with best practices and dispatch agent usage guidelines
- Improved agent tool implementation with better parameter validation and error handling
- Increased max_tool_uses limit from 15 to 30 for improved agent flexibility
- Optimized agent implementation to avoid redundant checks and improve performance

- Restricted agent tool to use only read-only variants of filesystem tools for security
- Simplified agent tool implementation to focus on multi-agent operation
