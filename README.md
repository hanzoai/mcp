hanzo-mcp --install
```

For development, if you want to install your local version to Claude Desktop:

```bash
# Clone and navigate to the repository
git clone https://github.com/hanzoai/mcp.git
cd mcp

# Install and configure for Claude Desktop
make install-desktop

# With custom paths and server name
make install-desktop ALLOWED_PATHS="/path/to/projects,/another/path" SERVER_NAME="hanzo"

# Disable write tools (useful if you prefer using your IDE for edits)
make install-desktop DISABLE_WRITE=1
```

After installation, restart Claude Desktop. You'll see "hanzo" (or your custom server name) available in the MCP server dropdown.
